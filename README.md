## Information

My name is Benyamin Bamburac, my Lewis University email address is [benyaminfbamburac@lewisu.edu](mailto:benyaminfbamburac@lewisu.edu), and this project is Animals App.

## Credit

This code is straight from following the following [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmGmLFcukM) from Brad Schiff. He gets full credit for this application.

## Instructions

To obtain a copy of this project, run the command `git clone https://https://github.com/bambamboo15/animals-app.git`, which will make a `animals-app` subdirectory in the folder you run this command in. The website can then be viewed in `index.html` of the subdirectory. The only required files are `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js`.
